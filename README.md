# ASL_classification
Trains and classifies images of ASL symbols

Trains on a data set of images then can make predictions given an input image. Will automatically resize and rescale images loaded by the user. This was a project in an NVIDIA DLI course.

Run `augmentation.py` to train, fit, and save the model. Then you can choose the path of an image in `prediction.py`. I will eventually wrap this in a main method to just pass an argument then run etc.

Dependencies will be updated later.
